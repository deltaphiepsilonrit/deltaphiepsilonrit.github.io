                        We strive to bring new students into our sisterhood who embody our core principals of Justice, Sisterhood, and Love, 
                        and enrich this sisterhood. The <b>Delta Phi Epsilon New Member Experience and Education</b> help new members get more familiarized 
                        with the core values of this sisterhood, educate them on our local and national history, and host bonding events to get to know 
                        the sisters who will become life long friends. We follow the Delta Phi Epsilon mission during Education, that being to “...inspire 
                        and empower our sisterhood to engage in a lifetime of leadership and service.”

                        New members attend weekly meetings throughout their education. <b>PEARLs</b> (Personal Enrichment Activities for Responsible Living) 
                        help highlight the <b>Five S’s: Scholarship, Self, Service, Social, and Sisterhood</b>. These events and activities are attended

                    <p class="contentPara">
                        <b>Q: I have heard bad things about Greek Life, is DPhiE like that?</b><br>
                        Only 2% of the U.S. population have participated in Greek Life, leading a lot of Greek perception to be based on media or stereotypes 
                        taken from people who usually have never joined a Greek organization. While Greek organizations do hold social events, RIT has strict 
                        guidelines on alcohol and drug possession and consumption, and we follow these rules as do other organizations affiliated with Greek Life. 
                        Our social events have included painting/game nights, movie marathons, and baking competitions. Many of our socials even include community service, 
                        sports competitions, alumni brunches, group trips to hockey and Homecoming games, and study sessions! 
                    </p>
                    <p class="contentPara">
                        <b>Q: Does DPhiE haze? What is hazing?</b><br>
                        Hazing is defined as an action taken or situation created intentionally to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule. 
                        Hazing is usually seen in the efforts of initiation to a club or organization. Delta Phi Epsilon Sorority, as well as overall RIT Greek Life, has zero 
                        tolerance for hazing of any kind.  Delta Phi Epsilon Sorority goes on record as having a strong opposition to any form of hazing or situation that may 
                        be construed as any form of hazing. Our Chapter holds ourselves to the standards of treating our new members with respect and uplifting them into the 
                        sisterhood, and do not allow for hazing of any kind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="contentPara">
                        <b>Q: I’m Transgender/Non-Binary/Gender Nonconforming/LGBTQIA+. Can I join DPhiE?</b><br>
                        Delta Phi Epsilon International Sorority’s Policy on Trans Women and Gender Non-Binary individuals is as follows:<br>
                        <i id="quote">
                        “We welcome all women as they self-identify, regardless of gender expression. This includes cisgender women and transgender women. Those individuals who identify as 
                        gender non-binary may be considered for membership, provided they are committed to the advancement of womanhood. Individuals who identify as male are not eligible for 
                        membership regardless of their commitment to the advancement of womanhood and/or identification with women’s issues and concerns. No member is required to provide 
                        documentation regarding their gender.”<br>
                        </i>
                        Delta Phi Epsilon International Sorority is also welcoming of students in the LGBTQIA+ Community, and we strongly believe that you should never change 
                        yourself to be apart of DPhiE. As an organization, we value and treasure people for who they are, not having to change who you are or who you 
                        love to be a part of our organization.
                    </p>
                    <p class="contentPara">
                        <b>Q: I’m a second/third/fourth/fifth year student, can I join DPhiE?</b><br>
                        RIT Greek Life has no restriction on when you can start the recruitment process. We understand that everyone’s journey is individual, and there is no limit or time 
                        constraint on when you may join an organization here at RIT. We accept undergraduate students of all years!
                    </p>
                    <p class="contentPara">
                        <b>Q: How much of a time commitment is DPhiE?</b><br>
                        It depends on the sister, and how long a sister has been in the chapter. The first semester after receiving a bid does have a more intensive commitment due to New Member 
                        Education and preparing them before initiation, and it can feel like a lot. However, Initiated sisters are only expected to attend weekly chapter meetings and various, 
                        often spread out mandatory events. We have many sisters who are members of other extracurriculars or work intensive majors, and we say DPhiE, as well as overall Greek Life, 
                        is as much or as little as you’d like to make of it!
                    </p>
                    <p class="contentPara">
                        <b>Q: Will Greek Life hurt my grades? Will I miss classes?</b><br>
                        Delta Phi Epsilon has many academic resources available to sisters to help support them in all academic areas as needed. Scholarship is one of our Five S’s, and we recognize 
                        that we are students of RIT first, sisters second. We do not encourage skipping class or other acts in order to participate in sisterhood activities. We have study hours, 
                        mentorship programs, and sisterhood workshops that can help a sister out with tests, exams, or projects. Greek Life isn’t an exception to discipline and your own drive towards 
                        your academics, the only one who can truly help yourself succeed is you! DPhiE is here to be your support and cheering squad every step of the way.
